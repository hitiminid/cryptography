# List 1 

## Problem 1 
Construct an algorithm which predicts next bits of *linear congruencial generator*, use this algorithm to construct a distinguisher (statistical test) which can distinguish output generated by an instance of LCG from a random string.

## Problem 2
Your goal is the same as in Problem 1, but here, the generator is *glibc's* random().
