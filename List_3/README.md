# List 3 

## Problem 1 
Implement a program which which encrypts/decrypts selected file(s) on disk. The program takes as inputs:

* mode of encryption, at least: OFB/CTR/CBC. . . (it has to support `AES_cbc_encrypt`,
you can use `openssl`),
* path to a keystore (generate a keystore using e.g.,: keytool (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html),
* key identifier.

Password to the keystore has to be read from a config file or from a command line.<br>
Prepare unit tests for each supported mode of encryption.<br>
The program needs to support two modes:
* **encryption oracle** on input consisting q messages: <m^1, ..., m^q> it returns it ciphertexts.
* **challenge** - on input m_0, m_1 program picks independently, uniformly at random a bit b and returns a ciphertext c_b of a message m_b.

## Problem 2 
Implement a CPA-distinguisher which is capable of winning (with probability 1) a CPA-experiment with a modified version of `AES_cbc_encrypt`. <br>
You may assume that the program from the previous problem generates consecutive IVs by incrementing its value by 1, each time it is run. Alternatively you may assume that each IV is generated by e.g. LCG or glibc random generators.
