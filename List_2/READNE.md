# List 2 

## Problem 1
Implement the following algorithms and test the quality of generated random bits depending on the parameters:
1. RC4(N, N)-mdrop[D]
2. RC4(N, 2NlogN)-mdrop[D]


Repeat experiments for different values of N = {16, 64, 256} and for key-lengths: {40, 64, 128} and for D = {0, 1, 2, 3}.<br>
For statistical tests use any of: TestU01, DieHard, Dieharder.
