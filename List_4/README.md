# List 4

## Problem 1 

Implement Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem (use gmp-like library to support large numbers). Implement `<Gen, Enc, Dec>` functions.

## Problem 2

Use your AES implementation from Lab3 to implement Merkle-Puzzle cryptosystem.

Run your system for N = 2^n, where n = 24, 32, 40 and compute and / or estimate space and time requirements. You need to prepare a presentation of the system with n = 24 (at least).
